  - ✅ Complex multi-agent scenarios
  - ✅ Maximum fault tolerance needed

  ---
  🎯 PATH 4: _process_user_query_basic() - LEGACY FOUNDATION

  Purpose: Original basic processing with conversation context
  Location: orchestrator.py:757Architecture: Basic broker → Direct agent coordination →
  Regex parsing

  ❌ CONS

  - 🏗️ Legacy architecture: Older coordination patterns
  - 🐌 Likely slower: No caching optimizations
  - 📊 Basic metrics: Limited performance tracking
  - 🚀 Basic broker only: Requires non-MCP broker mode

  🎯 WHEN TO USE

  - ✅ Legacy system compatibility
  - ✅ Simple deployment needs
  - ✅ Conversation-heavy applications
  - ❌ Performance-critical scenarios

  🔄 DUPLICATION ANALYSIS

  🔥 HIGH DUPLICATION AREAS

  1. Query Parsing Logic (3 different implementations!)

  - Path 2: _extract_structured_query() → ConsumerAgent → LLM-based
  - Path 3: _parse_query_with_fallback() → ConsumerAgent + Regex fallback
  - Path 4: _parse_query_with_consumer_basic() → extract_query_preferences() regex

  2. WebSocket Status Updates (Repeated in all paths)

  - Similar status sending patterns
  - Query analysis, completion, error handling
  - Could be consolidated into shared utility

  3. Consumer Agent Creation (4 different patterns)

  - Each path creates ConsumerAgent differently
  - Different parameter passing
  - Inconsistent error handling

  4. Result Processing (Similar patterns)

  - Product enhancement logic
  - Ranking and filtering
  - Response formatting

  🎯 CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES

  Shared Query Parser Service

  class UnifiedQueryParser:
      async def parse(self, query: str, user_context: Dict = None) -> ParsedQuery:
          # Consolidated logic from all 3 parsing methods
          # Single source of truth for query understanding

  Shared Result Processor

  class ResultProcessor:
      async def enhance_and_rank(self, products: List, user_context: Dict, parsed_query: 
  ParsedQuery) -> List:
          # Consolidated product enhancement logic

  WebSocket Status Manager

  class StatusManager:
      async def send_query_progress(self, session_id: str, stage: str, data: Dict):
          # Consolidated status update patterns

  🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

  🎯 IMMEDIATE FIX (Current Sprint)

  Route API to Path 2: Change main.py:314
  # Change from Path 1 (broken) to Path 2 (works)
  orchestrator.process_user_query_with_hybrid_pipeline(request, conversation_id)
  Impact: Fixes complex queries immediately with better performance

  🔧 MEDIUM-TERM REFACTOR

  Consolidate to 2 paths:
  1. Production Path: Enhanced Path 2 (performance + parsing)
  2. Enterprise Path: Enhanced Path 3 (MCP + fallbacks)

  Remove: Path 1 (broken), Path 4 (legacy)

  🏗️ LONG-TERM ARCHITECTURE

  Single Unified Path with mode selection:
  async def process_user_query(
      self, 
      request: QueryRequest,
      mode: ProcessingMode = ProcessingMode.OPTIMIZED  # OPTIMIZED | ENTERPRISE
  ) -> QueryResponse:
      # Single path with mode-based feature selection

  Bottom Line: Path 2 is the immediate solution - it has everything Path 1 needs plus
  superior performance targets. The system accidentally chose the worst of 4 available
  paths.
